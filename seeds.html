            <h3>Cauliflower Seeds</h3>
            <img src="cauliflower.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
        <p>Cauliflower is a sun-loving, cool-season crop to grow in spring and fall. An annual plant in the cabbage family, cauliflower has edible white flesh that is extremely healthy and considered a “superfood.”</p><br />
            <h4>Growing instructions</h4>
            <p>Cauliflower is a cool season vegetable that prefers a sunny location and fertile, well-drained soil. Incorporate plenty of organic matter and a complete fertilizer into the area before planting. Plant seeds ¼-½ inch deep, 2-3 weeks before the last frost. Thin seedlings or transplant cauliflower 12-18 inches apart in the row with rows 2-3 feet apart. Avoid growing during the heat of summer, as yield and quality are reduced. Irrigation should be deep and infrequent. Use plastic or organic mulches to conserve water and reduce weeding. Control insects and diseases throughout the year. Tie the leaves over the head to avoid developing off colors. Harvest cauliflower when the heads are white, large and compact.</p><Br /><br />
            <h3>Okra Seeds</h3>
            <img src="okra.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
            <p>Okra thrives in warm weather and is traditionally grown in the southern U.S., though there are varieties for northern growers, too. Once it’s harvest season, pick the pods every day so it doesn’t get overripe and tough.</p><br />
            <h4>Growing instructions</h4>
            <p>
                Plant okra in hot weather when evening temperatures are in the 60s or warmer.
                Space okra plants 10 inches apart in a very sunny area that has fertile, well-drained soil with a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.0.
                Improve native soil by mixing in several inches of aged compost or other rich organic matter.
                Okra loves the heat and can withstand a dry spell, but do your best to give plants 1 inch of water every week.
                Promote a more abundant harvest by regularly feeding with a continuous-release plant food
                Harvest okra pods when they are 2 to 4 inches long
            </p><br /><br />
            <h3>Bean Seeds</h3>
            <img src="bean.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
            <p>
                Beans are the seeds from flowering plants in the Fabaceae family and are classified as legumes.

                Several beans grow in pods or capsules that develop from flowers. Other legumes include peas, peanuts, and lentils. These beans are available dry, canned, or frozen.

                They differ nutritionally from green beans or wax beans where a person eats the entire pod.
            </p><br />
            <h4>Growing instructions</h4>
            <p>
                Plant snap beans in spring after the last frost and once the soil is warm.
                Space bean plants 8 inches apart in a warm, sunny spot in your garden that has fertile, well-drained soil. For the highest production, arrange them in double rows.
                Before planting, improve native soil by mixing in several inches of compost or other rich organic matter.
                Water in gently and keep soil consistently moist throughout the growing season by watering when the top inch of soil becomes dry.
                For best results, feed snap beans regularly with a water-soluble plant food.
                Add a 3-inch layer of mulch to keep pods clean, retain soil moisture, and prevent weeds.
                Take steps to prevent cutworms, slugs, and snails.
                Harvest beans every other day once they are large enough to eat.
